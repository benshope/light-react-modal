# Minimal React Modal

The idea behind this modal component is to keep it simple.  The implementation is one file, it handles most use cases, and it has no dependencies.

## Install

- **Npm:** `npm install minimal-react-modal --save-dev`
- **Yarn:** `yarn add minimal-react-modal --dev`

# Use

See the [examples](https://benshope.github.io/minimal-react-modal) and the [examples source code](https://github.com/benshope/minimal-react-modal/blob/master/stories.js) for usage snippets to copy.
