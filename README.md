# Minimal React Modal

The idea behind this modal component is to keep it simple.  This implementation should handle most use cases and never need to change.  It is one file and only two peer dependencies.

## Install

Npm: `npm install minimal-react-modal --save-dev`
Yarn: `yarn add minimal-react-modal --dev`

# Use
