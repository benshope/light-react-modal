# Light React Modal

The idea behind this modal component is to keep it simple. The implementation is one file and it has no dependencies.

## Install

- **Npm:** `npm install light-react-modal --save-dev`
- **Yarn:** `yarn add light-react-modal --dev`

# Use

See the [examples](https://benshope.github.io/light-react-modal) and the [examples source code](https://github.com/benshope/light-react-modal/blob/master/stories.js) for snippets to copy.
